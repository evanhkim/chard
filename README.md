## description
Chard - Chinese flashcard program - is a free Chinese study tool modeled after popular sites like Quizlet. 
It allows users to create flashcards pairing Chinese characters with their corresponding definitions. Chard then offers users a practice mode to memorize these flashcards. The unique thing about Chard is that it allows users to directly write Chinese characters by hand on their phone or other touchscreen devices (tablet, computer, etc.). The program takes these handwritten characters and using a CNN algorithm identifies the Chinese character that best matches the handwriting. 

Using pen and paper is no longer needed, test your understanding all in one place at www.runmun.app/chard.
